Note: some of the important files for figure generation need to be downloaded from https://scover-figures-data.cog.sanger.ac.uk/browser.html. These were uploaded there as the file sizes exceeded the maximum for github files. 

Guides for how to reproduce the invidual figures can be found in the corresponding folders:

- [Figure 2 and 3](https://github.com/jacobhepkema/scover_figures/tree/master/Figure2-3)
- [Figure 4 and 5](https://github.com/jacobhepkema/scover_figures/tree/master/Figure4-5)
- [Figure 6](https://github.com/jacobhepkema/scover_figures/tree/master/Figure6)
