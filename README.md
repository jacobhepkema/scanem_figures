Note: some of the important files for figure generation need to be downloaded from https://scover-figures-data.cog.sanger.ac.uk/browser.html. These were uploaded there as the file sizes exceeded the maximum for github files. 

Guides for how to reproduce the invidual figures can be found in the corresponding folders.
